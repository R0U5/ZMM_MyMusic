Preamble
This license lets you use, study, modify, and share the software for any non‑commercial purpose, as long as you
(1) provide attribution to the original developer and
(2) pass on the same non‑commercial, attribution, and source‑availability terms to recipients and users, including users who interact with the software over a network.
If you want to use the software commercially, you must obtain a separate commercial license from the Licensor.

0. Definitions
“Licensor” means the copyright holder(s) granting this License.
“Licensed Work” means the software and any associated materials distributed under this License.
“Covered Work” means either the Licensed Work or any modification, adaptation, or derivative of it.
“Distribute” includes making available, conveying, sublicensing, or otherwise providing copies of a Covered Work to any party.
“Network Use” means making a Covered Work available for use by others over a network (including providing it as a service).
“Non‑Commercial” means not primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation. Non‑Commercial use excludes (a) use by or for the benefit of a for‑profit entity (including internal use), (b) use in or for any product or service that is sold, licensed, leased, or otherwise monetized, and (c) use in advertising or to generate advertising, subscription, or usage revenue.

1. Grant of Rights (Non‑Commercial Only)
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor grants you a worldwide, royalty‑free, non‑exclusive, irrevocable (except as stated in Section 8) license to, solely for Non‑Commercial purposes:
  (a) use, run, and reproduce the Covered Work;
  (b) modify, adapt, and create derivative works of the Covered Work;
  (c) distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display the Covered Work; and
  (d) make the Covered Work available for Network Use.
No patent rights or copyrights are granted for Commercial Use under this License.

2. Attribution Requirement
Any distribution, public use, or Network Use of a Covered Work must conspicuously give appropriate credit to the Licensor as the original author, include the project name, a link to the project home page (if available), and the text “Used under NC‑OSL‑A 1.0.”
  (i) In source form: retain all copyright notices, this License text, and a NOTICE file listing the attribution.
  (ii) In non‑source or user‑facing form (e.g., a GUI or web app): display “Powered by [PROJECT NAME] by [LICENSOR NAME]” in an about dialog, footer, or equivalent location accessible from all primary views. If space is limited (e.g., CLI), print the attribution in “--version” or startup output.
  (iii) In academic or public materials (blogs, papers, talks): cite the Licensor and project name.
You may not remove or alter attribution notices.

3. Source Availability & Network Use (AGPL‑style requirement)
If you Distribute a Covered Work in any form, you must provide the complete corresponding source code under this License, including build and installation instructions, either (a) with the distribution, or (b) via a durable network location offered at no charge.
If you enable others to interact with a Covered Work via Network Use, you must ensure that each user can immediately obtain the complete corresponding source code of the version running, under this same License, at no charge.

4. Copyleft — Same License
Any Covered Work you distribute or make available for Network Use must be licensed as a whole, and exclusively, under this License. You may not impose further restrictions or remove any requirements of this License. Sublicensing under different terms is not permitted for Non‑Commercial use.

5. No Commercial Use
Commercial Use of the Covered Work, in whole or in part, is prohibited under this License. To obtain Commercial Use rights, you must negotiate a separate license with the Licensor. Any purported Commercial Use under this License is void.

6. Patents (Non‑Commercial Grant; Retaliation)
For Non‑Commercial use only, the Licensor grants you a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free patent license to make, have made, use, and distribute the Covered Work. If you initiate or join a patent claim alleging that the Licensed Work infringes a patent, your rights under this License terminate automatically as to the Licensed Work.

7. Trademarks
This License does not grant permission to use the Licensor’s trademarks, service marks, or trade names, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Covered Work and reproducing the attribution required by Section 2.

8. Termination; Reinstatement
This License automatically terminates if you violate its terms. If you cure the violation within 30 days of discovery, your license is provisionally reinstated unless and until the Licensor explicitly and finally terminates your rights. Termination does not affect third‑party licenses validly granted by you prior to termination, provided those parties remain in compliance.

9. No Warranty
THE COVERED WORK IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON‑INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT THE COVERED WORK WILL BE ERROR‑FREE OR SECURE. YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT.

10. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, DATA, OR USE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LICENSE OR THE COVERED WORK, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

11. Severability; No Waiver
If any provision of this License is unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in effect. No failure or delay by the Licensor in enforcing any right or provision will constitute a waiver.
